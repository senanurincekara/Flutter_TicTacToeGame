# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Flutter. It includes a home page for starting the game and a game screen page where two players can play against each other.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay: Players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid.
- Alternate turns between Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O).
- Win detection: The game automatically detects when a player has won by placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
- Draw detection: The game checks for a draw if all spaces are filled without a winner.
- Reset game: Option to reset the game board and start a new game.
